            Virtual reality in education may sound like science fiction, 
            but these two industries go hand in hand better than you’d think. 
            The growing field of VR has the potential to enhance learning by providing 
            students with access to virtual environments where they can engage with 
            immersive content from a range of subjects, such as art, geography, biology, 
            and chemistry.

            Virtual reality in education often involves viewing or interacting with learning content using 
            a VR headset along with any associated hardware, such as controllers that can let the user navigate
            and manipulate a simulated reality. VR headsets use screens, lenses, and other advanced technology 
            like sensors that are designed to wrap the viewer in a 360-degree view of a virtual setting.
