# HTML Personal Website (Course Assignment)

This repository contains my HTML/CSS website created for my coursework.
The layout may not fully match the original version because the submitted
copy was downloaded back from the portal and some assets were missing.
I am currently in the process of restoring the original design.

## 📌 Features
- Multi-page website (Home, Introduction, VR pages)
- Navigation bar
- CSS styling (fonts, colors, backgrounds)
- Images and basic formatting
- Organized folder structure (html / css / images)


## 🔧 Status
Some styling and images may appear incorrect because the first version
was lost. Updates will be added soon as I restore the original layout.
