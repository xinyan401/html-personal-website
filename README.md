# HTML Personal Website (Course Assignment)

This repository contains a basic multi-page HTML/CSS website created for my coursework.
The project demonstrates my understanding of:

- HTML page structuring
- CSS styling and layout
- Linking multiple pages
- Organizing files into folders (html / css / images)

The original submitted version was extracted from the course portal, so some
styling and images may differ from the initial design. This repository focuses 
on code structure rather than visual presentation.


## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of an Internet Programming coursework and is included in
my GitHub portfolio to showcase my early experience with:

- Front-end development basics  
- File and folder structure organization  
- Linking multiple HTML and CSS assets  

This website is not intended to represent final UI/UX quality but to demonstrate 
coding fundamentals and assignment work.

## 🔧 Status

The project reflects the restored version from the original submission files.  
Further UI updates may be added later.
